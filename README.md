# Myncer

Myncer aims to be an all-in-one solution for keeping your music up-to-date across all streaming platforms.

- Transfer playlists between music platforms
- Sync playlists (hourly, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly)
- Better sync options
  - one-way sync (ex. Spotify is the master and Tidal just mimics Spotify)
  - two-way merge (ex. Spotify & Tidal are merged into a master list and the master list is propagated to both). This one's the money.

## Motivation

I'm a huge audiophile and use Tidal for streaming to my Hi-Fi setup and Spotify to discover music. I'm a create-a-playlist for everything kinda guy and always struggle to keep them in sync. I've gotten tired of using proprietary technologies like Soundiiz.com, tunemymusic.com, and such mostly cause I'm a cheapskate and blew all my dough on Hi-Fi speakers ðŸ˜¥. This aims to be an open-source alternative to these tools. I do plan on hosting this at [myncer.hansbala.com](https://myncer.hansbala.com). It shouldn't be too costly.
